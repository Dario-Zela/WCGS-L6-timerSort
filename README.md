The task is to:

1) Read and understand the existing code and structure
2) Comment the  code
3) Write and test the bubble() and merge() sort algorithms. 
   You may have to write/modify this in an exam.
4) Write and test the quick sort alogorithm - this is a quite a bit harder. 
   You may have to describe this algo in an exam
5) Write and test the heap sort alogorithm - not part of the currciulum.
   This may be needed for your NEA.
   
Tasks 4) and 5) are quite a bit harder than bubble and merge sort - so give your self time to implement!
